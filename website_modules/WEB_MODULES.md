# Website Modules

This folder contains the *website_modules* which act as an interface between the client and the website.

A module for each site is needed to facilitate quering and parsing the resulting information for various brands and stores.

## Usage

- [NLIP Server](https://github.com/nlip-project/nlip_server), is required to use the libraries provided
- [NLIP SDK](https://github.com/nlip-project/nlip_sdk), is required for development

## Examples

A [Hello World Program](./hello_world/) can be found in its respective folder.

Module files are commonly used in a similar fashion to a library, although some can be run as [scripts](./deluce_bookstore_module.py) to test the usage.
